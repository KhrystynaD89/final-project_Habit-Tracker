# HABIT TRACKER - final project for DCI WebDev course FBW22-E10

## Overview: 

The idea behind this project is to build a web-based app for habit tracking based on a minimalist design-philosophy, aiming to reduce friction and "get out of the way" as much as possible, enabling users to build and stick with desired habits in their day-to-day. The ultimate goal is to create an efficient and effective tool for real-world application. 

To achieve that goal, the app's design is rooted in key principles of habit formation and adherence as laid out by authors such as James Clear ("Atomic Habits"), Charles Duhigg ("The Power of Habit"), BJ Fogg ("Tiny Habits") and Cal Newport ("Deep Work", "Digital Minimalism"). 

That being said, this very foundation is precisely the reason why the app might in some ways feel simplistic and limited – this is a conscious design choice. As coach and author Dan John likes to remind us: "The goal is, to keep the goal the goal." As such, it was the team's vision to create an app without a lot of bells and whistles, which in actuality always risks ending up as just another layer of distraction from the actual work – all under the guise of providing "insight" or "motivation".

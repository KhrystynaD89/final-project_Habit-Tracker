This GitHub repository contains Mongoose models, which are used for defining the structure of data in a MongoDB database for Node.js applications. Specifically, it includes a User model and an Address sub-document schema.

The User model represents user data, including fields like username, password, email, and more. It also has features like automatic timestamps and the ability to include an optional homeAddress sub-document, which can store address information.

On the other hand, the Address sub-document schema defines the structure for storing address-related data, including fields like street, number, and postcode.

In practical terms, these models are designed to make it easier to work with user data and addresses in a MongoDB database within a Node.js application. Developers can use these models to create, retrieve, update, and delete user records, optionally associating them with address information. This simplifies the process of managing user data and addresses in their applications.
